# Genetic-Algorithms-for-Solving-the-Traveling-Salesman-Problem
This project aims to implement various genetic algorithms to find optimal or near-optimal solutions for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem, where the objective is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.
